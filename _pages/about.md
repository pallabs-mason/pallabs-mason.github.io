I am a Professor of Information Systems at the Costello College of Business at George Mason University. I also serve as the Chair of the Information Systems and Operations Management (ISOM) Area. Previously, I served as the Director of MBA Programs for three years.

I received my Ph.D. in Information and Decision Sciences, and MBA in Finance and Management of Information Systems (MIS) from the Carlson School of Management at University of Minnesota. Before that, I studied Computer Science at the Indian Institutes of Engineering Science and Technology.

My research focuses on the design and economics of information systems. I teach Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Digital Transformation, and Management of IT to undergradute and graduate students, as well as business executives.

I have been serving as an Associate Editor of Information Systems Research (ISR) since 2018. Additionally, I am an Editorial Review Board Member at the Journal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS), where I previously held the role of Associate Editor for three years.
